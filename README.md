# Junior Dev Sweden

## What is this?
This the repo for Junior Dev Sweden (JDS). It's a collaborative project with the aim to develop a simple
website for JDS.


### What and who are Junior Dev Sweden?
Well, we do not have a website to link to (yet). However, we do have a very friendly community within 
[our discord server](https://discord.gg/rSBqw7qE) that you are welcome to join!

### UI design
Our friend oscarthroedsson came up with an overall design for our website. This is the UI we will use.
All the information about the UI can be found in our common [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/HTO5PqyePipbHLqEETrOJq/JDS-(Junior-Dev-Sweden)-Design?node-id=0-1&t=VGUG0zMonMLvi34a-1).
